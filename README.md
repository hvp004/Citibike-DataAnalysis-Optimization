# Citibike Data Analysis and Optimization

Citibike bike sharing system has been contributing in New York Cityâ€™s public transportation since 2013. This project focuses on the issue of the availability of an appropriate number of bikes at a station and the factors affecting the use of Citibike sharing system. Citibike provides its bike usage data to public for analysis and improvements in their initiative. Their data for the month of March, July, October, and December was analysed along with the weather data. The observations include charts showing ride patterns for all four months and the variation in bike usage during peak hours, weekdays, weekends, and public holidays for different types of users. Correlation with weather parameters like snow, wind, and temperature was found.  A direct dependency of these parameters on number of riders was observed. Moreover, popular routes with the high number of riders were found to solve one of the issues and contribute to the bike sharing industry.

### About Dataset:
The data has files from the month of July 2013 to January 2018. I have analyzed the data from four months of March, July, October and December for the year 2017 to cover all the seasons.
The dataset contains the following attributes:

| Attribute | Metadata of Attribute |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Trip Duration (in seconds) | Shows the time it took to finish the bike ride |
| Bike ID | Unique ID for the bike |
| Start Trip Timestamp | Timestamp when the trip was started |
| End Trip Timestamp | Timestamp when trip was ended |
| Start Station ID | Station ID of the station from where the trip was started |
| End Station ID | station ID of the station where trip ended |
| Start Station Name | NYC addresses consisting of St and Ave |
| End Station Name | NYC addresses consisting of St and Ave |
| Start Station Latitude / Longitude | Coordinates of the `Start Station Name` | 
| End Station Latitude / Longitude | Coordinates of the `End Station Name` |
| User Type | Customer => 24-hour (1 day) pass or 3-day pass; Subscriber => Annual Membership |
| Gender | (Zero = Unknown; 1 = Male; 2 = Female) |
| Year of Birth | Birthyear of the user |

### Results:

#### A. Rush Hour 

There are two peaks for `usertype` Subscriber while `usertype` Customer has a curve from 10 AM to 7 PM with maximum number of customer riders.

#### B. Daily Ride Analysis

There is a fine correlation between the fact that if a particular day is a weekend or not and the number of subscribers and number of customers. The number of subscribers are particularly high on weekdays while the number of customers are high on weekends. This makes sense as the subscribers are the users who use CitiBike service for their daily commute to and from work. A special case can be noticed for 4th of July, which is the public holiday. Even though 4th of July is a weekday, we have a higher number of customers on that day.

Similar kind of a trend is observed for the month of March. However, the total number of riders are decreased for both the type of usertype customer and subscriber. While there is a drastic reduction in user type customer, number of subscribers are decreased as well. Specifically, on the days of 14th, 15th and 16th of March, no riders are noticed. As with subscribers, more number of subscribers are noticed for the weekdays and on weekends, more number of customers are noticed.

Similar trend for month of October. However, significantly lower rides in last week of October is observed.

In December, very low number of rides are noticed. That makes me wonder if weather parameters are affecting.
