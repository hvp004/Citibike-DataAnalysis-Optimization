# Citibike Data Analysis and Optimization

Citibike bike sharing system has been contributing in New York Cityâ€™s public transportation since 2013. This project focuses on the issue of the availability of an appropriate number of bikes at a station and the factors affecting the use of Citibike sharing system. Citibike provides its bike usage data to public for analysis and improvements in their initiative. Their data for the month of March, July, October, and December was analysed along with the weather data. The observations include charts showing ride patterns for all four months and the variation in bike usage during peak hours, weekdays, weekends, and public holidays for different types of users. Correlation with weather parameters like snow, wind, and temperature was found.  A direct dependency of these parameters on number of riders was observed. Moreover, popular routes with the high number of riders were found to solve one of the issues and contribute to the bike sharing industry.
